    "Hi, this the first module of the python course. By the end of this course, you will know about ways to store and manipulate data and to deploy data science tools for your own proposes. Nowadays, you can use python to build any piece of software such as Python is open source. Secondly, it is very easy to build packages which is code that you can share with other people to solve specific problems. Currently, there are two version of Python, version 2.X and 3.X, where the X represents de upgrading of each version. In the moment that this tutorial was written, the version correspond 2.714 and 3.7.2 however i encourage download two version before the last one. In this course, we will work in the version 3.X. !Be sure to install the aforementioned version!. In this link, you can acces the download package [here](https://www.python.org/). \n",
