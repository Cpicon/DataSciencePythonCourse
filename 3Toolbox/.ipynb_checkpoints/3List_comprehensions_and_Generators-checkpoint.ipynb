    "# Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface generators in Python look like functions, but there is both a syntactic and a semantic difference. One distinguishing characteristic is the yield statements. The yield statement turns a functions into a generator. A generator is a function which returns a generator object. This generator object can be seen like a function which produces a sequence of results instead of a single object. This sequence of values is produced by iterating over it, e.g. with a for loop. The values, on which can be iterated, are created by using the yield statement. The value created by the yield statement is the value following the yield keyword. The execution of the code stops when a yield statement has been reached. The value behind the yield will be returned. The execution of the generator is interrupted now. As soon as \"next\" is called again on the generator object, the generator function will resume execution right after the yield statement in the code, where the last call exited. The execution will continue in the state in which the generator was left after the last yield. This means that all the local variables still exists, because they are automatically saved between calls. This is a fundamental difference to functions: functions always start their execution at the beginning of the function body, regardless where they had left in previous calls. They don't have any static or persistent values. There may be more than one yield statement in the code of a generator or the yield statement might be inside the body of a loop. If there is a return statement in the code of a generator, the execution will stop with a StopIteration exception error if this code is executed by the Python interpreter. The word \"generator\" is sometimes ambiguously used to mean both the generator function itself and the objects which are generated by a generator. "
